<p>Commuters are traveling distances to make a living. Statistics say over 10 million consumers drive more than 60 minutes each way to work and research shows that commuting can take a toll on a consumer’s health. This is the reason why commuting poses to be a daily grind on individuals.</p>



<p>In recognition of the National Stress Awareness Day on April 17, Dodge, a division of the Chrysler Group, is going great lengths to aid commuters to lessen the daily stress grind. In this regard, the automaker is inviting annoyed commuters to write an essay about why they believe they have the most stressful daily drive and are most deserving of a new car.</p>



<p>Participants can register and submit their entries online. During registration, participants will be asked to submit a 250-word essay answering the following questions: “What makes your commute so stressful?” and “How would owning a 2008 Dodge Avenger relieve your stress?” Participants must be 18 years or older, and a holder of a valid driver’s license at the time of entry.</p>



<p>The lucky writer will be flown out to Los Angeles, a territory famed for the worst commute situations. There, the winner will take part in Dodge?s “Avenge Your Commute” special event scheduled Monday which falls on April 16. In the said event, the winner will also take home an all-new 2008 Dodge Avenger.</p>



<p>The new Avenger from the automaker offers more catchy Dodge body parts accented by new features like the Chill Zone(TM), a MyGIG Multimedia Infotainment Radio and a heated/cooled cupholder. The features are designed to alleviate the drive feel of car occupants at the same time reduce the stress of commuting. The automaker teams up with internationally renowned life coach, Dr. Martha Beck, to supply tips on improving some of the stress that goes along with battling bumper-to-bumper traffic.</p>



<p>“Let’s face it; not every commute is going to be a fast ride,” said Beck, a best-selling author and columnist for O, The Oprah Magazine. “Accepting that fact from the word ‘go’ is probably the most important thing we can do to keep our commuter-stress levels low. Then, when we’re on the road dealing with slowdowns and pile-ups, we can use all kinds of strategies to get even more relaxed.?</p>



<p>Beck added, ?Ultimately, even bumper-to-bumper gridlocks can become opportunities to get back in touch with ourselves and turn a potentially stressful situation into a positive experience. With a little conscious attention, the commute we’ve come to dread can become a genuinely enjoyable part of our lives.”</p>



<p>“Commuters are spending a lot of time in their cars each day and we believe it is important for them to be comfortable and confident that their car will get them to their destination safely,” said Tom Loveless, the Director at Dodge Brand Marketing and Global Communications. “The Dodge Avenger offers a perfect blend of reliability, innovative technologies and bold styling, which sets it apart from the other mid-size vehicles on the road. By awarding one lucky commuter with a new Avenger, we hope to help him or her jumpstart their commute, and make the ride more pleasurable and less stressful.”</p>

<p>Formula 1 or F1 as it is also known is by far the most exciting and dangerous sport of our time. There are a variety of drivers, circuits and cars; making for one hell of an experience.<br>
Each season is a new challenge, for the teams, the drivers and the car designers and manufacturers. The World Drivers Championship and World Constructors Championship are competed for by the drivers and teams respectively. In every race the drivers and teams compete for points. Two drivers per team earn the constructors points which are added up over a season. </p>



<p>Obviously the racing itself is the main event. These are usually based on a two week rota. Travelling all over the world to compete, the drivers and teams have huge financial backing. Sponsorship is based on a “Whoever pays the most” rule. Every team is backed by a large company. </p>



<p>However for all the car enthusiasts; the range of high performance cars on offer also makes this one of the most popular global motorsports. The technology has changed dramatically over the last few years, with more and more emphasis being placed on the machine as opposed to the driver. One slight technical error and the race is over, choose the wrong type of tires and it’s race over, driver error and the race is over. There is a fine line between success and failure to keep everyone on their toes.</p>



<p>The most well known and possibly the hardest track in the world is located in Monaco. With a combination of twisting streets the Monaco grand prix event makes for a dangerous but highly exciting spectacle. The glitz and glamour is renowned throughout the world and followed by an array of A – lists celebrities. </p>



<p>The (FIA) International Automobile Federation controls and regulates Formula One. The organization scrutinizes the whole racing structure, and ensures all rules and procedures are followed correctly. Like in all motorsports the competition is fierce and the boundaries are pushed to the very limit. Cars are inspected and checked for any illegal discrepancies before racing commences. </p>



<p>There are so many different factors to this motor sport it is made interesting for everyone, fans watch it on TV, kids of every age play F1 racing games on their games consoles and all generations have a basic understanding of the elements which make driving so great, for this reason F1 is simply one of the best.</p>

<p>Indian automaker Tata Motors Ltd. intends to enter the global auto market in the near future. To increase its visibility, the automaker is expected to buy Jaguar and Land Rover which both belong to the Ford Motor Corp.?s Premier Automotive Group (PAG).</p>



<p>Experts in the industry said that the potential Indian takeover of European brands Jaguar and Land Rover would be a boost to local pride. The acquisition is a clear-cut sign of India?s economic progress. This is an effort of the Indian automaker to step on Active Brakes Direct to put a halt to global market uncertainty.</p>



<p>But a number of industry analysts and investors question whether a bid by Tata Motors, a manufacturer of workhorse trucks and low-end mass market cars, for the two luxury brands of Ford would make much business sense.</p>



<p>Chairman Ratan Tata confirmed last month that he is clearly interested in entering the competition for the iconic Britain-based auto makers, which have been put on the auction block by the struggling Dearborn-based automaker. Several private equity firms in the United States are also expected to submit bids.</p>



<p>Tata said that such an acquisition would help bring global visibility to his group, a conglomerate that makes everything from automobiles to steel and software, and a name that until recently was esoteric outside the Indian soil.</p>



<p>Tata Steel made a splash in January when it won a bidding war to buy Anglo-Dutch steel maker Corus Group PLC for $12.1 billion, the Detroit News reported. That said deal is deemed to be India’s biggest foreign acquisition. It stresses the country’s recent outward expansion into the global economy.</p>



<p>But while the Corus acquisition was widely seen as a good match, and appears to be paying off, experts do not see similar synergies in a Tata Motors takeover of Jaguar and Land Rover, the report added.</p>



<p>Jaguar and Land Rover are luxury brands that cater to a small percentage of customers and have a limited distribution network. What Tata needs more, if it wants to reduce its dependence on Indian buyers, is a large overseas sales network that targets the mass market, experts say.</p>



<p>“It makes no sense at all,” said S. Ramnath, an auto analyst at SSK Securities Ltd., Mumbai-based brokerage firm. “It’s passion that is behind this move.” Still, people tracking the matter say Tata Motors has a good chance of bagging the bundled sale of Jaguar and Land Rover brands.</p>



<p>A possible bid from the Indian automaker puts it in competition with American private equity firms, including One Equity Partners LLC and Ripplewood Holdings LLC that each have partnered with former Ford executives.</p>



<p>Long an iconic player in truck and bus manufacturing, Tata has only about ten years of experience selling cars, and most recently, has grabbed headlines with its plan to make an ultracheap car. The automaker has been successful selling into the mushrooming Indian market.</p>



<p>The Indian automaker, headquartered in Mumbai, is developing a car which will be up for sale next year for about $2,500. The car will be considered the most affordable vehicle ever made in real terms.</p>



<p>Tata Motors, formerly known as TATA Engineering and Locomotive Company or TELCO, is India’s largest passenger automobile and commercial auto manufacturing company. It is also the world’s fifth biggest commercial auto manufacturer.</p>

<p>To increase the power from your car engine, you can increase the size of the engine, or increase the pressure of the air in the intake manifold using a supercharger or a turbocharger. Increasing the sheer size of your car’s engine will give you more power, but will also result in higher fuel consumption (and costs) as well as a heavier engine.</p>



<p>So let’s look at increasing the air pressure in the combustion chamber. A supercharger, driven by the engine, forces more air into the inlet manifold to generate more power at engine speed; however, since the supercharger is run off the engine, it actually uses some of the extra power it generates.</p>



<p>A turbocharger, on the other hand, achieves the same objective of forcing more air into the manifold, but it’s driven by the waste energy from the exhaust manifold, not by the engine. It is basically a turbine and a compressor connected by a common shaft and supported on a bearing system. The turbocharger can convert waste energy from the exhaust manifold into compressed air, which it pushes into the engine. This allows the engine to produce more power and torque and improves the overall efficiency of the combustion process.</p>



<p>The first prototype of a turbocharged diesel engine in history was in 1915 by Dr. B?chi, Chief Engineer of Sulzer Brothers Research Department. Around the 1940’s the aircraft gas turbine led to advances in materials, technology and design; which brought on the turbocharger development of radial turbines and led to the use of radial flow turbos on small automotive diesel engines. During the 1950’s the major engine producers like Volvo and Cummins started to experiment with turbocharged engines for trucks. This led to a German engineer producing a more innovative compact design and in 1954 the engine producers were starting to offer a range of turbocharged engines. Pole position at Indianapolis in 1952 was won by a car powered by one of Cummins’ turbocharger engines.</p>



<p>The benefits of using a turbocharger are increased engine power output, improved fuel consumption, improved emissions, and altitude compensation. So in the end a turbocharger is the way to go if you’re looking for that little bit of speed in your ride.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, all car sellers would be 100% honest, but this isn?t a perfect world. After all, do you really expect car sellers to be all ?what you are looking at is a piece of junk and in addition to my $5,000 price tag you need to spend a few thousand dollars on repairs?? This isn?t going to happen. For that reason, protect yourself from sellers who outright lie or slightly stretch the truth. How can you do this?</p>



<p>Remember That People Lie: You don?t need to outright accuse all vehicle sellers of lying because some might have a great quality vehicle that needs no repairs or has had no issues in prior years. With that said, it doesn?t matter how ?nice? someone seems because if they have a car that they can?t sell without stretching the truth a bit, they are going to stretch. While you don?t want to be over-the-top paranoid, it is important to know that this practice does take place.</p>



<p>Gather Information About the Car Beforehand: If you do your research online and do a search on a vehicle site or use a desktop car finder, you will get a lot of good information ahead of time. You should see some detailed pictures; get the vehicle?s make, model, year, and mileage. This information can and should be used for a small amount of research.</p>



<p>Test Drive the Vehicle: Unless you know the risks of buying a long distance car, you are encouraged to set your sights on local vehicles. This is because you can test drive and inspect the car. Test driving can alert you to any problems with that specific car, such as the need for a new headlight, new tires, or new brakes. </p>



<p>Research the Car in Question: Before you go and test drive a vehicle, do research on the vehicle itself. Testing driving is important for specific vehicle issues, but what about any know problems that may be plaguing entire models? Look at a customer reviews and see what current or former owners have to say. Then, look at recall information. If you find a car that had been recalled due to a part malfunction, ask the seller if that issue was fixed.</p>



<p>As stated above, there are benefits to searching for cars online first because you can gather information and do this research ahead of time. If you ever find yourself at a dealership lot on impulse, never agree to buy a car right away. Gather information on the vehicle make, model, and year and then return home to do a check online for recall information, customer reviews, and so forth.</p>



<p>Know You Have a Choice: So lets say that you agree to meet a vehicle seller to test drive their car. You get there and are basically looking at a car that isn?t nearly as good as it was made to sound online. What should you do? You have a choice. In fact, you have many choices. First, you can walk away. Second, you can buy the car at the price the seller is asking. Third, you can negotiate and get a lower price because the vehicle wasn?t so great after all.</p>



<p>Check Estimated Values: As stated above, you can negotiate a better price (if you want) if you ever catch the vehicle seller in a lie. But what type of price should you go down to? Instead of just pulling a figure out of midair, do your homework first. Visit the Kelley Blue Book website and plug in the make, model, year, and mileage. What you want to do though is three separate value checks on one car ? all the different conditions. So say you are faced with a poor car instead of an excellent car, you have a good value to toss back at the seller who lied.</p>



<p>Now that you know how to handle sellers who misrepresent their cars are you ready to start buying?</p>
